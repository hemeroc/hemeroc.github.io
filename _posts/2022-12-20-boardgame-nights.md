title: How Team Board Game Nights Improve Working Together
---

In the modern workplace, it's essential to keep employees motivated and engaged to achieve success. One way to do this is to prioritize the role of fun. As a leader this means not only setting clear goals and expectations but also making sure your team has opportunities to relax and have fun together. Especially during stressful times, it can be beneficial to step away from work for a bit and engage in activities that promote bonding and enjoyment.

One way to accomplish this is by organizing team board game nights. Not only can these nights provide a fun and engaging activity for everyone to participate in, but they can also improve team dynamics and working relationships.

# The Importance of Fun at Work

It's no secret that work can be stressful and demanding, and this can take a toll on the mental and emotional well-being of employees. Incorporating fun and lighthearted activities into the workweek can help alleviate some of that stress and promote a more positive and enjoyable workplace.

Research has shown that when employees have fun at work, they are more engaged and productive, and experience lower levels of burnout and turnover. Incorporating games and other fun activities can also help break down barriers between team members, promote communication and collaboration, and foster a sense of community within the workplace.

# The Benefits of Team Board Game Nights

One way to promote fun and team bonding is by organizing board game nights. Not only are board games a classic form of entertainment, but they can also help improve cognitive skills, such as strategic thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. Also especially in IT they keep you away from a screen which most definetly is an extra plus.

The benefits of board games go beyond simply having fun and improving cognitive skills. Playing board games as a team can also improve communication, teamwork, and collaboration. Games like `Captain Sonar`, for example, require players to work together and communicate effectively in order to win. This can help build trust and respect between team members and improve overall team dynamics.

Another great game to play is `Codenames`, where players work together to find hidden agents while avoiding traps. This game requires effective communication, critical thinking and some personal knowledge on how your team approaches problems, as players must work together to decipher clues and strategize their moves.

# Relating Board Game Nights to Self-Sustaining Teams

Organizing board game nights can also tie into the concept of self-sustaining teams. By allowing team members to organize and lead these events, leaders can promote autonomy and self-management within the team. This can help build trust and confidence within the team, and allow team members to take ownership of their work and responsibilities.

Moreover, by promoting fun and positive experiences, self-sustaining teams can foster a sense of community and shared purpose, and help create a work environment that team members are excited to be a part of. This can lead to higher levels of engagement and commitment, as well as improved performance and outcomes.

In conclusion, incorporating fun and team-building activities like board game nights can help promote a positive and engaging workplace. By allowing team members to take ownership of these events, leaders can also promote self-sustaining teams and foster a sense of community and shared purpose. So why not plan your next team game night today?
